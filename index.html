            Sloths are a group of arboreal Neotropical xenathran mammals. They spend most of their time in the trees of tropical rain forests. 
            Their average weight is 22 pounds. All sloths have three toes.
        </p>
        <p> They hang upside-down on trees and they are very fuzzy. They are found within Central and South America.
            The first time I met a sloth in real life was in Costa Rica.
            A sloth's body is usually 50 to 60 cm long.

            The life span of a sloth is typically around 20 years.
            They are often called "nature's slowest animals."
            Sloths posess an ability to camouflage into their environment.
            They eat mostly leaves and buds, but they sometimes eat insects.
